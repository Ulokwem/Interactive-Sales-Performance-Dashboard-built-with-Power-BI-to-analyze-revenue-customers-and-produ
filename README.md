📍 Diversify Product Focus

    While Cans and Ct dominate, consider promoting other product categories (e.g., Bottles, Bags) to balance sales dependency.

📍 Pricing Strategy

    With no change in average unit price, explore dynamic pricing or premium offerings to increase revenue per unit.

📍 Seasonal Sales Optimization

    Identify months with dips in the sales trend and plan targeted promotions or campaigns during those periods.
